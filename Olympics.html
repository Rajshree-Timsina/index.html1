		<h2 style="color:  rgb(0, 0, 0);"> The Olympics is a major international multi-sport event where athletes from various countries around the world come together to compete against each other in various sporting events. The modern Olympic Games were first held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, and since then, they have been held every four years, except for a few cancellations due to wars and other extraordinary circumstances. <br> <br>

		The Olympic Games include both summer and winter sports, with the Summer Olympics featuring sports such as athletics, swimming, gymnastics, and basketball, while the Winter Olympics include sports such as skiing, ice hockey, figure skating, and snowboarding. The host city for each Olympics is selected several years in advance, and the event usually lasts for several weeks, with athletes competing for medals in their respective sports. <br> <br>
		
		The Olympics are not only a celebration of sport, but also an opportunity for nations to come together and promote international cooperation and understanding. The Olympic Games are often seen as a symbol of unity and a way to bring people from different cultures and backgrounds together. The Olympic motto, "Citius, Altius, Fortius" (which means "Faster, Higher, Stronger" in Latin), represents the spirit of competition, excellence, and striving for improvement that the Olympics embody. <br> <br>
